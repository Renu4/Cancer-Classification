# Cancer-Classification
There are two main classifications of tumors. One is known as benign and the other as malignant. My
problem here is to predict if the patient has benign or malignant cancer using image features from a
Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). There are 569 observations, out of 400 are provided for training. The data
is given in a file cancerWTrain.mat.
